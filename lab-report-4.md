# Lab Report 4 - Vim
## Vim
### Step 4
![step 4](step_4.png)
Keys Pressed: *ssh <command + v> <enter>* My ieng6 username (cs15lfa23nd@ieng6.ucsd.edu) was previously copied into my clipboard, so all I needed to do to log in was to ssh then paste my username.

### Step 5
![step 5](step_5.png)
Keys Pressed: git clone <command + v> <enter>  I previously saved the SSH URL (git@github.com:nayR0D/lab7.git) of the lab7 fork to my clipboard, so all I needed to do is paste it into the terminal with git clone to clone the repo.

### Step 6
![step 6](step_6.png)
Keys Pressed: cd lab7 <enter>, history <enter>, !86 <enter>, !87 <enter> First, I had to change directory into the repo I just copies which is lab7. Then I can open my terminal history which saves all the commands I had previoulsy ran in this terminal. The compile command, javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java, was saved in my history as command 86, and the run command, java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests, was saved in my history as command 87. By typing !86, and !86 I'm able to re-run those commands respectively. 

### Step 7

![step_7_2](step_7_2.png)
Keys Pressed: vim List<tab>.j<tab> <enter>, </>index1 <enter> <shift + n>, e, x, i, 2 <esc>, :wq First, I had to use vim to edit the file. By pressing typing vim and List<tab> it autocompleted to ListExamples, then with .j<tab> it autocompleted to ListExamples.java. In the vim program, I searched for the index1 I wanted to change by hitting the </> key, then typing index1<enter> to search for index1. Pressing <shift + n> searches for the last instance of index1 which is the one I wanted to change. pressing e, brings the cursor to the last character of the word which in this case is the "1" in index1. Pressing x will delete the 1, and pressing i will enter insert mode where I can then press 2 to insert a 2 where the 1 was. Now I just press <esc> to escape insert mode then type :wq to write quit the file.

### Step 8
![step 8](step_8.png)
Keys Pressed: !86 <enter>, !87 <enter> Since the compile command, javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java, and the run command, java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests, are still in the same section of the command history, I can just re-run the !86 and !87 command to run the compile and run commands.

### Step 9
![step 9](step_9.png)
Keys Pressed: git add List <tab> <enter>, git commit -m "fixed ListExamples.java"<enter>, git push<enter> I first had to stage the file I changed to the commit object with git add, and autofilled the rest of the file name with <tab>. I then created the commit with git commit with the -m option to add a message. I then pushed the changes up to the remote repo with git push.
